He began learning to play the guitar when he was 16 years old, earlier in his adolescence. When he first casually played his older brother’s guitar, he got enthralled with the prospect of learning to play the guitar.</p><p>Later, he received his high school diploma from St Brendan’s Primary School. He discovered his affinity for not just playing guitar but also singing while he was in elementary school. He began singing at school assemblies, where he received a lot of praise from school personnel and other students.&nbsp;Tom Parker decided to offer an audition for the reality TV music competition The X Factor after becoming more confident in his skills, however, he could not get it beyond the first round.&nbsp;Later, he attended Manchester Metropolitan University, where he studied Geography before abandoning his studies to pursue his singing career. He later became a member of a Take That tribute band. In 2009, he joined the band The Wanted.</p><h2>Tom Parker Height & Weight</h2><p><b>Tom Parker is 5 feet 11 inches tall</b><span>.

Tom was able to amass an $8 million USD net worth by working hard throughout the course of his ten-year career. He didn’t like grooming out of town with his family. But he always preferred to spend time at home with his wife and children.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>A great career, it is said, begins with tremendous difficulty, and this is how Tom’s amazing career began in 2009. After much difficulty, Tom was able to get a spot in the rock band The Wanted in 2009.&nbsp;He made it through the audition for The Wanted band. He passed the audition and was chosen as one of the band’s five members. Nathan Sykes, Siva Kaneswaran, Max George, and Jay McGuiness were also chosen to join The Wanted band.</p><p>However, before settling on a name for their band, Tom Parker and his fellow band members released their first record. “All Time Low,” Tom’s first song with his band, was released on July 25, 2010. After receiving a positive reaction from the crowd, Tom and his bandmates released a variety of tracks.&nbsp;Tom’s band, The Wanted, launched their own reality show, The Wanted Life, on channel E! in 2013. Tom and his fellow band members took the unthinkable choice to disband the band in 2014.&nbsp;He progressed in his profession by appearing in many reality programs. He appeared on Celebrity Masterchef in May 2015 but was ousted during the semi-finals stage. Then, in February 2016, he took over as Tina Hobley’s replacement on the reality program The Jump.
