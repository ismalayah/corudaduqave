<time>13 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=377 data-injectable=true data-video=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> recently confirmed that the hit series <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ginny and Georgia</a></strong> has been renewed for a third and fourth season. This is a pretty rare move for the streaming platform, which usually prefers to just cancel things people like with no warning. The comedy-drama was a surprise success for the platform, with fans not being able to get enough of the titular mother-and-daughter duo.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>The show follows Ginny and Georgia as they settle into life in a new town. While initially everything seems perfect, Georgia’s troubled past starts catching up to her and it gets more and more difficult to hide the truth from her daughter.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Before the series found its audience on Netflix, the cast wasn’t too well known, with plenty of fresh faces marking the show as their first major acting gig. Regardless, a lot of the cast have practically become household names since the show first dropped.</p><h2 id=h-brianne-howey data-injectable=false>Brianne Howey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ginny-and-Georgia-season-2.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>One half of the titular duo, Brianne Howey plays Georgia, a mother to Ginny and fiancée to the mayor. Howey’s other projects include some pretty well-known TV shows such as the CW Networks’ Batwoman and The Exorcist TV show. Although her role as Georgia is undeniably one of her most well-known roles to date.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Georgia came from a broken home, living in a trailer park until she decided to run away as a teen. Her experiences with men and the stress of surviving on her own taught her to be wary of others and to protect her daughter and son no matter what, even if protecting them meant committing murder.</p><h2 id=h-antonia-gentry data-injectable=false>Antonia Gentry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ginny-and-Georgia-4.jpg><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Antonia is relatively new to the spotlight with only a few acting credits under her belt before taking the lead role opposite Howey. Before Ginny and Georgia, Gentry had appeared in an episode of the Netflix show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Raising Dion</a>, she had also appeared in the 2015 film Driver’s Ed: Tales from the Street.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Her iconic role in Giny and Georgia has seen the actress gain quite the following. Being one of the main characters, we get to spend quite a lot of time with her character as Ginny struggles to balance her love life, home life, and school as well as dealing with the truth about her own mother.</p><h2 id=h-felix-mallard data-injectable=false>Felix Mallard</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ginny-and-Georgia-3.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Mallard hails from Australia and appeared in the well-known Australian soap Neighbors (the same show that gave <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Margot Robbie</a> her start) before his appearance in Ginny and Georgia. He plays Marcus, the heartthrob and boy next door to Ginny who struggles with his own demons. Mallard has a few other acting credits to display including the Netflix show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Locke and Key</a> among other projects.</p><h2 id=h-diesel-la-torraca data-injectable=false>Diesel La Torraca</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ginny-and-Georgia-2.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>One of the youngest members of the cast, Diesel plays Georgia’s other son, Austin, and like Ginny, he struggles to fit in at first as he’s bullied at school by Zach (Connor Laidman). Georgia also helps him stand up to Zach in a pretty unconventional way. Diesel’s first acting project was back in 2019, he starred alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lupita Nyong’o</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Gad</a> in Little Monsters when he was eight.</p><h2 id=h-supporting-cast data-injectable=false>Supporting Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ginny-and-Georgia-1.jpg><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>There are quite a few regulars who appear in every episode including Sara Waisglass as Marcus’ brother and Ginny’s best friend. Scott Porter, known for Friday Night Lights, plays Mayor Randolph and the fiancé to Georgia. Nathan Mitchell plays Ginny’s dad, Zion, while Aaron Ashmore plays Auston’s dad, Gil. Raymond Ablack plays Joe, a cafe owner and another love interest of Georgia’s. Then there are Ginny’s friends, Abby, played by Katie Douglas, Norah played by Chelsea Clark and Hunter Chen, Played by Mason Temple.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Beyond that, you’ve also got the younger versions of most characters who appear in flashbacks throughout the series. Nikki Roumel plays a young Georgia Miller while Kyle Barry plays the teenage Zion. Ben Caldwell plays the young Gil Timmins and we also see a teenage Joe played by Yatharth Bhatt.</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=false>Whilst the show focuses primarily on Ginny and Georgia (obviously) the rest of the cast have their own dramas audiences catch a glimpse of. Characters like Abby and Norah have moments where we get to learn more about their story and follow them on a character arc. Hopefully, the next two seasons will continue to focus on other characters. Even getting a bit more backstory on characters such as the younger Joe (Yatharth Bhatt) would be a great way to give a bit more development to some of the supporting cast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmna6knGKwor%2FTZqafZZeeu6%2FFjJqlnWWXmryzs8iaZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-full-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-full-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-full-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-full-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-full-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-full-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerod-mixon-age-height-weight-biography-wiki-net-worth-in-2021-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerod-mixon-age-height-weight-biography-wiki-net-worth-in-2021-and-more.html>Jerod Mixon Age, Height, Weight, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./scarlett-byrne-bio-wiki-age-family-husband-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html>Scarlett Byrne Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Husband, Movies, TV Shows and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./scarlett-byrne-bio-wiki-age-family-husband-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
