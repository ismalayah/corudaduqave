He was also given the opportunity to join the select team that trains against Team USA in advance of the Summer Olympics and participated in two games for the Suns during the Las Vegas Summer League.</p><p>In another 39-point performance on January 12, 2017, he scored 28 points in the fourth quarter to break Stephon Marbury’s previous record of 26 points from 2002 for the most points in a quarter for the Suns.</p><p>In a 98-92 loss against the Brooklyn Nets on November 6, 2017, Booker scored 18 points to achieve 3,000 career points and becoming the fourth-youngest player in NBA history to do so, behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony.</p><p>On July 7, 2018, Booker and the Suns agreed to a five-year, $158 million deal extension. After having surgery to replace his right hand’s fifth metacarpophalangeal joint, which was damaged on March 14, 2018, he was declared out for six weeks on September 10.</p><p>In a 100-98 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on November 23, 2019, Booker nearly recorded a triple-double with 35 points, a career-high 12 rebounds, and 9 assists.</p><p>Booker surpassed 8,000 points on January 22, 2021, in a 130-126 overtime defeat against the Denver Nuggets, during which he strained his left hamstring.</p><p>On November 29, 2021, during the 2021–22 NBA season, Booker received the Western Conference Player of the Week award for his play in Week 6 of the campaign, which enabled the Suns to set a franchise mark with an 18-game winning streak.</p><p>Booker and the Suns reached a four-year, $224 million contract agreement on July 7, 2022. That same day, he was revealed as one of the NBA 2K23 cover heroes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Devin Booker have any children?</h2><p>Devin Booker has no children at the time of filing this report.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2cr6GeYq%2Bwu8qeqWabmJ65pb7Ep2Sdp5WoeqWx1aKlZpqfpLimvoyhmK%2BdXaC2pb%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdevin-booker-children-does-devin-booker-have-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdevin-booker-children-does-devin-booker-have-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdevin-booker-children-does-devin-booker-have-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdevin-booker-children-does-devin-booker-have-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdevin-booker-children-does-devin-booker-have-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdevin-booker-children-does-devin-booker-have-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-does-drew-gooden-make.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-does-drew-gooden-make.html>How Much Does Drew Gooden Make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./was-carl-weathers-married.html>Was Carl Weathers married?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./was-carl-weathers-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
