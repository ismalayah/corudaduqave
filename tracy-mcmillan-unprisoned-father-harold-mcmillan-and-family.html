<time>12 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Tracy McMillan Unprisoned father was Willie Harold McMillan. Harold McMillan passed away on January 21, 2023 at the age of 84.</p><p>McMillan is a self-proclaimed relationship expert, author, and television writer. She is in the limelight for her television series Unprisoned, which airs on Hulu.</p><p>The drama series tells a port-prison family story. It features a single mom and therapist whose life turns right-side-up when her father moves to her house after being released from prison.</p><p>The author first came to public notice following her viral blog post, Why You’re Not Married, which was released in 2011. It was the most-viewed article on HuffPost for two years.</p><p>Her screenwriting credits include Necessary Roughness, Chase, Mad Men, The United States of Tara, and Life on Mars. She has been the host of Family of Fiance since 2019.</p><p>Following her work in Mad Men, she received the 2010 Writers Guild of America Awards for Dramatic Series along with other series writers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan></span>Tracy McMillan Unprisoned Father Harold McMillan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tracy McMillan father Harold McMillan spent 31 years total in federal prison. Born on August 29, 1935, he passed away on January 21, 2023, at age 87.</p><p>He was an African-American born as the fifth of nine children to his parents at home in Midway, Alabama. He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the young of 20.</p><p>Harold&nbsp;looked after his daughter from 18 months until he went to prison when Tracy was just 3 years old. His departure forced her into foster care in multiple places.</p><p>Lots of individuals would have just forgotten about their kids in such a situation, but her dad wrote her, called her, and got her foster mother to bring her to see him, twice a year, 500 miles away.</p><figure></figure><p>Soon after he was released from prison, he took her back, only to be jailed again after only one year out of prison. Then he left again and continued to write her and call her like before.</p><p>He also got his former girlfriend to bring his daughter to see him in jail, three or four times a year. Before she hit adulthood, the cycle would repeat itself two more times.</p><p>He would still call her and ask someone to bring her to see him until she refused to go. By the time he was released in the early 1980s, McMillan wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>At that time, she had a handsome MBA-type boyfriend in her life. She then moved to California with him and settled down. At least after 3 years of not talking to him, one day she called him.</p><figure></figure><p>The father and daughter came together once again. For the next ten years, he stayed out of prison and they continued embracing their relationship. They visited a few times a year and talked on the phone.</p><p>In 1993, he got convicted again for drug trafficking and was sentenced to 23 years. He was released in 2013.</p><p>They grew close once again and simply resumed their relationship until Harold passed away in January 2023.</p><p>On January 27, the relationship expert took to her&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;to share a tribute to her father. There she talked about her dad’s both positive and negative sides. She said, “Of all the Bad Dads in the world, he was one of the best.”</p><figure></figure><p>She said her dad was selfish and vain, a liar, and a cheater, but wasn’t violent, angry, aggressive, or mean. The author said he was smart, verbal, spiritual, insightful, and sweet.</p><p>“He was just… a person. Flawed. Human. He lived. He was my dad,” she concluded the post.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tracy-mcmillan-lost-both-her-parents></span>Tracy McMillan Lost Both Her Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tracy McMillan parents are Harold Mcmillan and Pauline. Tracy considered Pauline her mother even though she didn’t give birth to her.</p><p>She has previously&nbsp;noted&nbsp;that her biological parents were both adult industry workers. Her mom was a girlfriend experience-type call girl and her dad was a pimp.</p><p>Her mother didn’t want to have a baby, so she gave her up when Tracy was just three months old. She went to foster care until her dad took her when she was 18 months old.</p><p>She spent her early years bouncing from one foster care to another. At the age of four, she was brought to the home of a Lutheran minister, his wife, and their five children.</p><figure></figure><p>In 1973, when Harold came out of prison, he took his daughter and they lived with his girlfriend, Pauline. She stayed with her for the next 10 years and calls her one of her main parents.</p><p>Sadly, both her main parents left the world in 2023. Her dad passed away on Saturday, and his longtime girlfriend, Pauline, on Sunday morning -both passed away within 24 hours of each other.</p><p>The author shared the news by posting a video clip on&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;where she talked about how she received the message and how Pauline raised her from the age of 8 to 18.</p><figure></figure><p>She memorialized her parents with a second&nbsp;IG post, where she shared more about her father and his girlfriend.</p><p>On January 24, she shared an old picture of herself with Harold and Pauline, taken in the summer of 1973. At the time, her dad was out of prison and she went to live with him and his then-partner.</p><p>After that, she stayed with Pauline until she was 18. “It was… intense. And not great. But there were good time,” she said of her time with her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tracy-mcmillan-has-a-son-joseph></span>Tracy McMillan Has A Son Joseph<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tracy McMillan has a 25-year-old son named Joseph. She shares her child with her second husband Jim.</p><p>In 2019, Joseph graduated from Lewis & Clark College. The author also attended her son’s graduation day and shared happy pictures of herself with her son on Instagram.</p><p>During the hello sunshine podcast&nbsp;My Best Break-up, McMillan shared about her toughest breakup with her son when he turned 18 and went away to pursue further studies in college.</p><figure></figure><p>McMillan has experienced three failed marriages. At 19, she married an older man, and even though she looked for stability, their marriage did not last long. She left him and landed alone in New York.</p><p>She then remained single for more than a decade and married a very nice minister’s son, Jim, at the age of 32. They were married only briefly until 1999 and had Joseph during that time.</p><p>The pair later divorced but agreed to co-parent their only child. She has previously praised Jim for being the best father for her son. She talked about him in a 2019 Father’s Day&nbsp;post.</p><figure></figure><p>McMillan said, “his fathering has been everything I could have wanted for my son.” “I may not have had the dad I needed growing up, but my son did,” she added.</p><p>At 40, she got married for the third time. Her third husband cheated on her so the pair divorced.</p><p>Currently, McMillan is involved in a romantic relationship with her partner, Bob. She often shares loving pictures of herself with him on socials.</p><figure></figure><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-true-story-in-hulus-unprisoned></span>Her True Story In Hulu’s Unprisoned<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>McMillan is the creator and executive producer of Hulu’s newest dramedy Unprisoned. The series is based on her real-life relationship with her formerly incarcerated father, Harold.</p><p>She says that she didn’t make the series as a favor for the viewers but rather as an outlet to deal with her own past trauma.</p><figure></figure><p>The storyline of the series mirrors her real life growing up with a criminal dad and going to different foster homes.</p><p>And while the author has previously opened up about her upbringing, the show helps her to unpack some of her heavy emotions.</p><p>Unprisoned premiered on March 10, 2023. It stars Kerry Washington, Jordyn Mclntosh, Delroy Lindo, Marque Richardson, and Faly Rakotohavana.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyilrC6ecycpKKknJa7bsHNqamiq5%2BjsqV5xZqroZ2iYrWivs6lm2alk6K2rbjAp2SappRis6K5yKWwaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan-and-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftracy-mcmillan-unprisoned-father-harold-mcmillan-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dick-miller-1930-2019.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dick-miller-1930-2019.html>Dick Miller: 1928-2019 | Features</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-overnighters-2014.html>The Overnighters movie review (2014)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-overnighters-2014.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
