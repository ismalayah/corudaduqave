It is also Eboa Lotina track by Cameroonian singer-songwriter Eboa Lotin and a song that defines him: he honestly speaks (sings), like what he would expect of a self-respecting radio to broadcast, about life and its social events, good and bad without sweeping anything under the rug.</p><p>In spite of his relatively small amount of releases (about 70 songs and an unfinished album), he is one of the best known and treasured African singer-songwriters of his generation, as well as one of the few ambassador-storytellers deemed griots by talent (as opposed to by blood) in Africa, from Ivory Coast to Gabon via Benin, Central Africa, Cameroon, DR Congo and further.</p><p>He spoke many languages including his native Duala but also Lingala which gave him high popularity in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries that shared the language. Thanks to his bringing his music and languages across countries, many tribes realised a fact that started to be buried with the oral knowledge of the ancestors and the times: that tribes define themselves beyond the artificial borders of profiting-man-made countries.</p><p>His music is simple and without frills, maybe because as he would say he knew nothing about music theory. However his talent is undeniable and his melodies still haunt today’s generations from Cameroon and the rest of Africa to far beyond, in Western countries as well as Latin America. He persisted pass discouragement, against all odds, until he eventually met to success. Self-taught, he was an artist first, excelling in music and sculpture.</p><p>His personality transpired in his songs, with fun and laughter in some songs, cries and pain in others exploring the wide range of social issues. His website reports that he remained the same humble man with the same prayer to God “Winning the law suit against the stomach and make a report to the sceptic tank</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmq%2BwrYylpq2hnmKvqrvGq5ipoKlirqixjJ%2BYpqGcrnqktMilm6udnmKwor7EnqlmnJWWwam%2FjJqlnWWemsS0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eva-padlock-hyde-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-464404-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eva-padlock-hyde-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-464404-html.html>Eva Padlock Hyde Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./take-the-lead-2006.html>Take the Lead movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2006)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./take-the-lead-2006.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
